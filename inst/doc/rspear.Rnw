\section{Functions in rspear}
\subsection{spear()}
\subsubsection{Description}
The main function in the rspear-package is spear():
\begin{lstlisting}
  spear(x, taxa = NULL, abundance = NULL, group = NULL,
    region = "Eurasia", traits = NULL,
    sensitivity = -0.36, generationTime = 0.5, exposed = 1,
    migration = 0, ...)
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent It takes the following arguments:
\begin{description}[0.5cm]
  \item[x] data.frame;  data.frame with abundances in the long format.
  \item[taxa] character; name of column in x, which holds the taxon-names.
  \item[abundance] character; name of column in x, which holds the abundances.
  \item[group] character-vector; names of columns for groupings.
  \item[region] character; default is set to 'Eurasia', which covers trait-data for Finland, United Kingdom, West Siberia and Central Europe. 'Finland', 'United Kingdom', 'West Siberia' are also allowed and traits may vary between different regions.
  \item[traits] NULL or data.frame; If 'NULL' (default) then it is checked if there is a file 'traits.csv' in the working directory and if this file is up-to-date with the database. If there is no such file, it is downloaded from the web-server. Or a trait-table as returned by \lstinline|spear()|.
  \item[sensitivity, generationTime, exposed, migration] Threshold values for classification into SPEAR. These values should only be changed if there is strong indication that they are different than these defaults! A species is classified to SPEAR if all criteria are met:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item sensitivity > -0.36 
      \item generationTime >= 0.5 
      \item exposed == 1 
      \item migration == 0
    \end{itemize}
  \item[...] additional arguments passed to get\_traits(). Currently only 'check' is available. By default the file is checked if up-to-date. See get\_traits().
\end{description}

Generally the defaults are appropriate and one must only specify \textbf{x, taxa, abundance and group}.\\[1em]



\subsubsection{get\_traits(), Trait-database}
In order to minimize traffic on server trait-data is saved locally in the \textbf{working directory} (ensure that it has be set correctly).\\[0.5em]

This is done in \lstinline|spear()|, via the internal function \lstinline|get_traits()|:
\begin{lstlisting}
  get_traits(check = TRUE)
\end{lstlisting}

\lstinline|spear()| checks if there is file 'traits.csv' in the working directory and otherwise downloads the trait-data from the web-server \url{http://www.systemecology.eu/spear/spear-calculator/} to a file 'traits.csv' into the working directory. \\[0.5em]

If this file already exists, it is checked if this file is up-to-date with the web-server.\\[0.5em]

\lstinline|get_traits()| takes one argument 'check' which disables checking when 'FALSE'. Check must be disabled when working offline. Check can be passed directly in \lstinline|spear()|, as in most of the examples here.



\subsubsection{Matching taxon names with trait-database}
\lstinline|spear()| matches the taxon-names with the trait table using direct and approximate string matching. It is very likely that the matches are not always 100\% (direct) (for example spelling errors, see example in section 'Usage of rspear'). \lstinline|spear()| then tries to find the species with nearest match (approximate match). However this approximate match must not always be appropiate! When there are non-direct matches a warning is printed and the user is called to check the match:
\begin{lstlisting}
  Warning message:
  Non-direct taxon matches!
Check trait table if match is appropriate!!
\end{lstlisting}

If spear cannot find an appropriate match in the trait table, the SPEAR-value for this species is set to '0' and a warning printed:
\begin{lstlisting}
  Warning message:
There were unmatched species:
xxxxxxxxx
 Set SPEAR to 0
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Output}
\lstinline|spear()| returns a list of two elements ('spear' and 'traits):
\begin{description}[0.5cm]
   \item[spear] a data.frame with the SPEAR-values for every combination of the grouping variables
   \item[traits] a data.frame with the following columns:
    \begin{description}[0.5cm]
    \item[region, exposed, generationTime, sensitivity, migration] species traits used to classify species into SPEAR.
    \item[SPEAR] Classification of species into SPEAR.
    \item[taxa\_data] taxon names as in x.
    \item[taxa\_matched] matched taxon-names in traits-database.
    \item[match\_val] goodness of match. '-1' indicates a direct match, 'NA' indicates a failed match. Values between 0 and 0.5 indicate an approximate match (smaller values - better match)
    \end{description}
\end{description}



\section{Usage of rspear}
The usage of the rspear-package is explained on fictitious example data. The example data is shipped with the package:

<<>>=
data(spear_example)
head(spear_example)
@

\noindent Description of the data-set:
\begin{description}[0.5cm]
  \item[Taxon] The taxon names. There are spelling errors in the taxon names (\emph{'Baetis rodani'}), Baetis is listed as \emph{'Baetis sp.'} and \emph{'Baetis'} and there is weird species named \emph{'xxxxxxxxx'}.
  \item[Abundance] Abundances
  \item[Year] There is data from different year, so this is a grouping variable (we want SPEAR-values per year)
  \item[Site] Data has been sampled at four sites, so this is also a group-variable
\end{description}



\subsection{Data requirements}
Like the web application rspear requires data in the long format (see \lstinline|spear_example| from above). 
Ecologists often organized their data in wide format (eg. species x samples matrix). This data must be transformed into the long-format, eg using the melt() function from the reshape2 package.

For example if we have a columns for every species (wide-format):
<<results=hide, echo=FALSE>>=
require(reshape2)
df_wide <- dcast(spear_example, Site + Year ~ Taxon, value.var="Abundance", fill = 0)[ , 1:6]
@
<<>>=
df_wide
@

We can transform it to the long format using \lstinline|melt| from the reshape2-package:
<<>>=
require(reshape2)
df_long <- melt(df_wide, id = c("Site", "Year"))
head(df_long)
@



\subsection{Calculation of SPEAR}
When we have the data in the long-format we can use \lstinline|spear()| to calculate the spear values.
First argument is our data in the long format (spear\_example), then we must specify the columns coding for 
taxon-names, abundances and grouping variables:

<<eval=FALSE>>=
sp <- spear(spear_example, 
            taxa = "Taxon", abundance = "Abundance", group = c("Year", "Site"))
@

Column names can be entered as characters or (less error-prone) using names():

<<>>=
names(spear_example)
sp <- spear(spear_example , 
            taxa = names(spear_example)[1], abundance = names(spear_example)[2],
            group = names(spear_example)[3:4], 
            check = FALSE)
@

Here we can take advantage of the defaults:
\begin{description}[1cm]
  \item[region = "Eurasia"] subsummarises Finland, UK , West Siberia and Central Europe
  \item[traits = NULL]  Will check if we have a local file of the trait-data and otherwise download it.
\end{description}

However we are warned, that there have been approximate matches and even no matches with the trait-table:
\begin{lstlisting}
Warning messages:
1: In spear(spear_example, taxa = names(spear_example)[1],  :
  There were unmatched species:
xxxxxxxxx
Set SPEAR to 0.
2: In spear(spear_example, taxa = names(spear_example)[1],  :
  Non-direct taxon matches!
Check trait table if match is appropriate!!
\end{lstlisting}

\vspace{1em}
We can check the matches looking at the trait-table returned by \lstinline|spear()|:
<<>>=
head(sp$traits)
@

Looking at \lstinline|match_val| we see that there has been no match (match\_val == NA) for taxon 'xxxxxxxxx'  and 'Baetis rodani' has been matched approximately  (match\_val = 0.1) with 'Baetis rhodani'. All other taxa have been matched directly (match\_val = -1). The SPEAR-value for 'xxxxxxxx' has been set to '0'. We could check and clean our input data, but the matches are appropriate in this case.\\[1em]

Now let's take a look at the SPEAR-values:
<<>>=
sp$spear
@

spear() return the result in a data.frame which can be directly used for further analysis (plotting, hypothesis testing, etc):

<<boxplot, fig=TRUE>>=
spear_df <- sp$spear
plot(SPEAR ~ factor(Year), data = spear_df)
@



\subsection{Modifying trait-values}
To modify trait-values we can use the trait-table returned by spear():\\[1em]
First we make a copy of the returned trait-table and then we can modify this table. 

For example we set that \emph{Baetis rhodani} is exposed to pesticides:
<<>>=
traits_modi <- sp$traits
traits_modi[traits_modi$taxa_matched %in% "Baetis rhodani", "exposed"] <- c(1,1)
head(traits_modi)
@

Note that when selecting \emph{Baetis rhodani} from the trait-table, we have to change two values, because of the spelling error in the data.\\[1em]

This modified trait-table can then be supplied to the 'traits'-Argument of \lstinline|spear()|:
<<>>=
sp_modi <- spear(spear_example , 
            taxa = names(spear_example)[1], abundance = names(spear_example)[2],
            group = names(spear_example)[3:4], 
            traits = traits_modi,
            check = FALSE)
head(sp_modi$spear)
head(sp_modi$traits)
@

Note that the SPEAR-values have changed, since \emph{Baetis rhodani} is now classified as Species Ar Risk.



\subsection{Modifying SPEAR-values}
\textit{This is currently not supported.}

However it can be done indirectly by modifying the trait-values (see previous section, most easily migration)
